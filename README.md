# Pumpkin Punter  
<br> <br>

## About
Unity Project branched from the 19-09-21 Presentation from Inland Empire Software Development

A pipe spout in the middle of a field spews pumpkins everywhere! 

I merged IESD's Spout project with an online tutorial on creating custom first person shooter cameras that interact with their environment. 

## My Changes

- Added more tombstones and cauldrens that disapear when walked into
- Added collusion detection with custom FPS camera
- Enlarged playing field and walls
- Added custom ground textures
